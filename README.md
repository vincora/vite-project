# Deadline tracker app

This is a web application designed to track and visualize your deadlines. You can set up multiple deadlines and see how close today's date is to the endpoint for each.
For example, you have several work projects at once that need to be completed by different deadlines and you want to see, how much time you have left for each of them.
Or you only know the approximate delivery time of your parcel (between two dates) and want to understand, if delivery is still on time or you should contact support service.
